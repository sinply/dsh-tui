 * @param maxChildLines - Collapsed budget independently applied to each top-level child's lines and
 * to the number of top-level children, so many siblings cannot grow the collapsed card without bound.
 * @param expanded - Whether to retain every rendered child line.
 * @param display - Escapes parsed text and attribute values for terminal output; character references
 * can expand to control characters that pre-parse escaping never saw.
 * @param label - Styles element names and attributes.
 * @param body - Styles the text content under those elements; the card's body tone, so tree
 * content matches the surrounding card rows instead of falling back to the default foreground.
 * @param omitted - Renders the omitted-line marker for a collapsed child or child range.
 * @returns Tree rows, or `undefined` when `source` is not one supported complete XML document.
